MongoDB for Java Developers
INTERMEDIATE COURSE

Learn how to use MongoDB as the database for a Java application.

You will play the role of a back-end developer for a Java application, where your job is to implement the application's
communication with MongoDB. Using the Java driver you will read and write data to the database, use the aggregation framework,
manage the configuration of the database client, and create a robust application by handling exceptions and timeouts.

You'll build the back-end for a movie-browsing application called MFlix.

Using the MongoDB Java Driver, you will implement MFlix's basic functionality. This includes basic and complex movie searches,
registering new users, and posting comments on the site.

You will also add more features to the MFlix application. This includes writing analytical reports, increasing the durability
of MFlix's connection with MongoDB, and implementing security best practices.
